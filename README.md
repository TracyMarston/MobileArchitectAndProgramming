# Mobile Architect and Programming
<strong>Question:</strong> <i>Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?<i><br><br>
  The goal of the Inventory Application was to supply a user the ability to add stock items into a local database with CRUD capabilities.
  <ul> 
    <li>C - Create an item </li>
    <li>R - Read an item(s) </li>
    <li>U - Update existing items</li>
    <li>D - Delete items within the system.</li>
  </ul>Additionally, the system was to provide the user notifications when inventory items were below a certain quantitiy. This notification was permission based and required the user accept notifications as it was using the SMS notification systems built into their smart device or phone. <br>

<strong>Question:</strong> <i>What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?<i><br><br/>
  The design was kept simple with a combination of 3 colors allowing the user to focus on the data within the inventory system. The layouts were also kept simple and consistent so the user knew what to expect. 4 screens were created, Login, Create an Account, Inventory List and CRUD screen.

<strong>Question:</strong> <i>How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?<i><br><br/>
  I ended up chunking the project into multiple pieces and focused on the processes one at a time in order to complete the project. I think having a game plan and a UML CLass diagram helps break down all new projects into managible pieces to code. This concept can be used on future projects.

<strong>Question:</strong> <i>How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?<i><br><br>
  I did not have time to write out complete Java test case statements due to time restrictions. Coding an entire system and writing test statements for a fully functioning application should be given more time than 2 weeks. This was the time given to coding the project for the course and it's not adequate time.

<strong>Question:</strong>< i>Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?<i><br><br>
 For me and the time allowed to fully code the project was limited. I ended up making myself a UML Class diagram based on layouts created for the project. From here it was a matter of coding and researching best practices to implement.
  
 #
<strong>Question:</strong> <i>In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?<i><br><br>
  Thanks to a previous course with MongoDB/MongoPy I think that I sucessfully setup a CRUD module to implement for the application.
